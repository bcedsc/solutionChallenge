**FAQs ![](Aspose.Words.7321a07c-6a8c-43c7-87d6-ab8dc27b4a4e.030.jpeg)**

- **Can my solution solve a problem outside of the scope of the 17 Sustainable Developer Goals?**

For Solution Challenge 2022, we **require** your submied solution to solve for at least one or more of the 17 SDGs. When you have submied your solution, please review all the 17 SD[Gs to ](https://sdgs.un.org/goals)understand which SDG your solution is focused on and what SDG targets you are looking to solve for.

- **Can one student or team submit with multiple submissions if they’ve contributed to both projects?**

No. The Terms and Conditions state “LIMIT ONE (1) ENTRY PER PERSON,” so each student can only be a pa of one submission.

- **Can I still paicipate in the Solution Challenge if there is no Developer Student Club at my university?**

Yes, as a student you can still paicipate as long as you team up with **at least one** student at an existing GDSC university. You must join the GDSC community through the GDSC [event plaorm.](http://dsc.community.dev/) We recommend you to then reach out to the GDSC lead for guidance on how to join or form a team with their community.

- **What is a Solution Demo? What should it feature?**

The solution demo is a demonstration video that shows the most impoant pa of your application. When evaluating, our judges will use the demonstration video to understand how a user will interact with the application.

Note that your video is limited to 2 minutes, so focus on what’s really impoant!

From the video, we want to understand how the user interacts with your application and its features. We don’t need to know about every lile feature detail, we care far more about the core value your solution is adding. So focus on the most impoant features and functionalities for the user.

- **In addition to Google’s developer tools, we used developer tools that were not created by Google. Does that still qualify?**

Yes. As per the T[erms and Conditions, we](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc-solution-challenge/terms) require that your submissions “Use of one or more Google products or plaorms including.” In addition to that, however, you can also use developer tools that Google did not develop.

- **Does our project have to be deployed for submission?**

No, it does not have to be deployed. If the project is deployed, this will help our judges get a better understanding of what you’ve built, but it is not required.

- **The submission form asks us for a link to our repository. How can we share our code repo while also keeping our code private?**

If you want to keep your repo private, you must use a private repo on Github and add gdsc.solutionchallenge@gmail.com as a collaborator, or we won't be able to view the codebase and therefore will have to disqualify your submission.

If you’re running a public repository on Github, Bitbucket, or similar version control system, you can simply give us the link.

Below is the relevant section from the Terms and Conditions:

*The link should direct the judges to a repository containing your code, which can be hosted on a Version Control System, such as Github or Bitbucket. In that repository, you should include a README.txt or README.md le in the root directory. This le should contain clear instructions on how to run your code for us to be able to test out the solution.*

- **I staed working on a project before the solution challenge staed -- can I submit it?** Yes -- it would be eligible for submission as long as it was built aer April 12, 2021.
